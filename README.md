# personal-website

## Motivation

personal-website is intended to be a redesign of my own portfolio website, likely to be hosted by GitHub Pages (or generally whatever service I decide on using by the time this is close to finished). The old website hosted under my username at https://golden2402.github.io/ is a template of a recipe website used for Virginia Tech's ENGL 3844 (Writing and Digital Media) class, and as such solely contains coursework I completed in that class. I need real portfolio website that reflects my personal strengths and skills.

## Design

The original iteration of this website (before I naively force pushed over it) was a single page React app served by Vite, but as per the discretion of Michael Atkins, I changed the website to use Next.js.
